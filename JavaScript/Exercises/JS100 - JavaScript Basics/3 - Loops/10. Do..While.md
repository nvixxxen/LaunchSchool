# Do...While

What is the difference between the following two code snippets? Check the MDN documentation on while and do...while.

```js
let counter = 0;

while (counter > 0) {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
}
```

```js
let counter = 0;

do {
  console.log('Woooot!');
  counter -= 1;
} while (counter > 0);
```


**Answer :**

The first snippet is a `while` loop, while the second snippet is a `do...while` loop. The difference between the two is that a `do...while` loop will **always** run at least once and then check the condition afterwards; on the other hand, a `while` loop checks the condition first and will not run at all if the condition is not met.
