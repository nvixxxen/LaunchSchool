# Loop and Log

Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  // include your code here
}
```

**Answer:**

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Expected output : 0 2 4 6 8 10
```
