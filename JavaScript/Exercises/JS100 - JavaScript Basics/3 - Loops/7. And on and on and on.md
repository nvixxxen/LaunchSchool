# And on and on and on

The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) Why is that? Also modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

```js
for (let i = 0; ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}
```

**Answer:**

The code keeps looping forever because there is no stop condition specified in the for loop.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 1 ; i += 1) {
  console.log("and on");
}

// Output: 'and on'
```
