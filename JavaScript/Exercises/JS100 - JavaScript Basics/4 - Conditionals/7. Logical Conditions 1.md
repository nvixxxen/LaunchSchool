# Logical Conditions 1

Predict the output of the following code:

```js
if (false || true) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}
```

**Answer:**

The code above will output `'Yes!'` regardless of the value that it's checking because the `if` statement is set to log `'Yes!'` if the the condition evaluates to either `false` OR `true`.
