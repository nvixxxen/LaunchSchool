# Logical Conditions 2

Predict the output of the following code:

```js
if (true && false) {
  console.log('Yes!');
} else {
  console.log('No...');
}
```

**Answer:**

The above code will always log `'No...'` because the `if` statement is configured to to only log `'Yes!'` when the condition evaluates to both `true` **AND** `false`.
