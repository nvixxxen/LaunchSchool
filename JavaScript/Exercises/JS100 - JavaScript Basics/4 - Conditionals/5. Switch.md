# Switch

Take a look at the code below. Without running it, determine what it will log to the console. If you're not sure, refer to the MDN documentation on `switch` statements.

```js
let animal = 'horse';

switch (animal) {
  case 'duck':
    console.log('quack');
  case 'squirrel':
    console.log('nook nook');
  case 'horse':
    console.log('neigh');
  case 'bird':
    console.log('tweet tweet');
  default:
    console.log('*cricket*');
}
```

**Answer:**

The above code will run :
```js
// 'neigh'

// 'tweet tweet'

// '*cricket*'
```

...because the `switch` statement does not include `break` statements after each case. The `switch` statement finds a matching case and starts executing from there, continuing to execute each subsequent case until it hits the end of the `switch` block and finishes.
