# Logical Conditions 3

Without running the below code, determine what will be logged to the console.



```js
let sale = true;
let admissionPrice = !sale ? 5.25 : 3.99;

console.log('$' + admissionPrice);
```

**Answer:**

The ternary operator in `admissionPrice` is configured to evaluate to `5.25` if `sale` is `false`, however, `sale` is `true` so it instead evaluates to `3.99` and ultimately logs `$3.99`.
