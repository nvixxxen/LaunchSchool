# Mountain Caps

### Is there a method to capitalize a string, for example turning `'mountain'` into `'Mountain'`?

While there is no method that can capitalize only the first letter of a word in JavaScript, it can still be done by chaining a couple methods together.

```javascript {"id":"01J4BSK9FKXHNMRDR8CG6P9HVR"}
const string = "mountain";
console.log(string[0].toUpperCase() + string.substring(1));

```
