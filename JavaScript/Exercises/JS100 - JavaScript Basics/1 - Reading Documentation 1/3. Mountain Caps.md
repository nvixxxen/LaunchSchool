# Mountain Caps

Is there a method to capitalize a string, for example turning `'mountain'` into `'Mountain'`?

While there is no method that can capitalize only the first letter of a word in JavaScript, it can still be done by chaining a couple methods together.

```javascript
const string = "mountain";
console.log(string[0].toUpperCase() + string.substring(1)); // 'Mountain'
```
