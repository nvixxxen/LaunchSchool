# Equality

In your JavaScript console, execute the following two lines of code to check whether their return values differ and if so, how. Take a look at the MDN documentation on equality comparisons to read about how == and === differ.

```javascript
"8" == 8; // true
"8" === 8; // false
```

[Equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) ... "attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types."

[Strict Equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) ... "always considers operands of different types to be different."
