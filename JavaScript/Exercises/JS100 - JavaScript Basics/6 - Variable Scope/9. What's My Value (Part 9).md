# What's My Value (Part 9)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
const a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  a = 2;
}

myFunction(a);
```

**Answer:** 

The above code will throw a `TypeError` because  variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be reassigned.
