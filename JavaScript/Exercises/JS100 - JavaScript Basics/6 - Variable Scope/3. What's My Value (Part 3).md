# What's My Value (Part 3)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue);
```

**Answer:**

Due to the `myValue` variable being declared inside the block of the `if` statement, it is not accessible outside of the block. The above code will throw a `ReferenceError` explaining that the `myValue` variable is not defined.
