# What's My Value (Part 10)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
const a = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
};

function myFunction() {
  a.firstName = 'Jane';
}

myFunction();

console.log(a);
```

**Answer:**


The above code would ouput `firstname: 'Jane', lastname: 'Doe'`. With the `const` keyword, a reference to `a` cannot be reassigned to a different object or primitive value but this rule doesn't apply to the properties of the object referenced by `a`.
