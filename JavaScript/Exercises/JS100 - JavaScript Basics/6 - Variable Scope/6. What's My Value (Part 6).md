# Whats My Value (Part 6)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
let a = 5;
let b = false;

if (a > 4) {
  let b = true;
}

console.log(b);
```


**Answer:**

The above code would log `false` to the console. This is because it is reading the value of the variable `b` from the first declaration on line 2. The second declaration of `b` is inaccessible from outside the `if` statement block. The expected output could be achieved by reassigning `b` in the second declaration (by removing the `let` keyword) instead of redeclaring it.
