# What's My Value (Part 1)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
console.log(greeting);

var greeting = 'Hello world!';
```

**Answer:**

The variable `greeting` is declared with the `var` keyword; as a result, the variable is hoisted and initialized in memory as `undefined` before the code executes. This is called **declaration hoisting** and it allows you to access the variable before declaring it, but it will always return `undefined`.
