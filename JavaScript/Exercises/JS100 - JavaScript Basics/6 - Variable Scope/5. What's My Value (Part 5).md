# What's My Value (Part 5)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
    let a = 2;
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

**Answer:**

The above code will throw a `ReferenceError` due to attempting to access the `a` variable from outside of the `if` statement block (the `let` keyword has block scope so variables cannot be accessed from outside the block). The expected output could be achieved by removing the `let` keyword from the declaration of `a` inside of the `if` statement block and simply reassigning `a` instead of re-declaring it : 

```js
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a)   //   1
    a = 2;
    console.log(a);  //   2
  }
}

myFunction();
```
