# What's My Value (Part 7)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js

let a = 1;

function myFunction() {
  console.log(a);
}

myFunction();
```

**Answer:** 

The above code would output `1` (the value of variable `a`) to the console because variables declared outside of a function or block are considered to be global variables and can be accessed from anywhere.
