# What's My Value (Part 4)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js
function myFunction() {
  let a = 1;

  if (true) {
    console.log(a);
  }
}

myFunction();
```

**Answer:**

The above code will log `1` to the console. The function declaration on the last line will evaluate to undefined due to it's lack of a `return` statement. In JavaScript, when a function doesn't excplicitly return a value, it impliticty returns `undefined`.
