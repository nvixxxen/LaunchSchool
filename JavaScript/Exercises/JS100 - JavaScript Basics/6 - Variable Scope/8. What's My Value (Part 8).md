# What's My Value (Part 8)

What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until you have tried to answer.

```js

let a = 1;

function myFunction(a) {
  console.log(a);
}

let b = 2;

myFunction(b);
```

**Answer:**

The following code will output `2`. This is because the parameter `a` of `myFunction` shadows the global variable `a` within the function's scope. Any reference made to `a` within the body of `myFunction` will refer to the function parameter, rather than the global variable. Parameter `a` is assigned the argument value `2` from variable `b`.
