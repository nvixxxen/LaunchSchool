let greeting = "Hello World!";

**Answer:**

When you declare a variable with the `let` keyword, it is hoisted similarly to declaration hoisting but it is allocated in memory as uninitialized. Attempts to access the variable prior to it's declaration will result in a ReferenceError because you can't reference a variable before it's declared and initialized.
