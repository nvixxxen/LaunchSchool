# Which year is this?

The MDN page for Date lists two methods to get the year of a date.

```javascript
let today = new Date();

today.getYear();
today.getFullYear();
```

What is the difference between the two methods and which one should you use?

**Answer:**

The `.getFullYear()` method returns the year for this date according to local time represented as an absolute number. The `.getYear()` method essentially returns the value of `.getullYear()` - 1900. ==You should always use `.getFullYear()` as `.getYear()` is depreceated.==
