# Equality

Predict the output of the below code. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?

```js
let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);
```

**Answer:**

The output of the above code is `false`. In JavaScript, Array objects in JavaScript are not primitive, so as opposed to comparing the values, JavaScript compares their location in memory. If two objects are in different locations in memory, `false` is logged.
