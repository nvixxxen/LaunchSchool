# Multiline String 

Take the following rhyme:

```plaintext
A pirate I was meant to be!
Trim the sails and roam the sea!
```

How can you assign this string to a single variable, preserving the line break?

**Answer:**

```js
let str = "A pirate I was meant to be!\nTrim the sails and roam the sea!";
```
